# Gradient Remedy for Multi-Task Learning in End-to-End Noise-Robust Speech Recognition

## Introduction

Gradient Remedy is a novel method to solve the gradient interference problem in multi-task learning for noise-robust ASR, i.e., conflicting gradients and wrongly dominant gradients.
It has improved the ASR performance on [Robust Automatic Transcription of Speech (RATS)](https://github.com/YUCHEN005/RATS-Channel-A-Speech-Data) and [CHiME-4](https://spandh.dcs.shef.ac.uk/chime_challenge/CHiME4/data.html) datasets.

Figure (a): Multi-task learning of speech enhancement (SE) and automatic speech recognition (ASR);

Figure (b): In case the SE and ASR gradients are conflicting (i.e., the angle between them is larger than $90^\circ$), we project the SE gradient onto a dynamic surface at acute angle $\theta$ to ASR gradient, in order to 1) remove conflict and 2) push SE gradient to assist in ASR optimization;

Figure (c): In case of wrongly dominant SE gradient (i.e., $\Vert G_\text{SE} \Vert_2 > K \cdot \Vert G_\text{ASR} \Vert_2$ , where $K>1$ is a threshold), we adaptively rescale the magnitude of two gradients to prevent dominant ASR task being misled by SE gradient.

## Usage

Our code implementation is based on [ESPnet](https://github.com/espnet/espnet) (v.0.9.6), please kindly use the following commands for installation.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YUCHEN005/Gradient-Remedy.git
cd Gradient-Remedy
pip install -e .
```

In our folder, the running scripts are at `egs2/rats_chA/asr_with_enhancement/{run_rats_chA_gradient_remedy, rats_chA_gradient_remedy}.sh`, the network code are at `espnet2/{asr/, enh/, layers/}`, and the optimization code are at `espnet2/train/`.
